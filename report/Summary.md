# Summary of Weather Data Analysis - Delhi

This project analyzed the **daily weather data of Delhi** over a period of 5 years, focusing on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The dataset was cleaned, missing or incorrect data handled, and date values converted to proper datetime format to facilitate analysis.

**Key Findings:**
- Daily mean temperature shows clear **seasonal trends**, rising in summer and falling in winter.  
- Humidity has a **moderate correlation with temperature**, especially in warmer months.  
- Monthly average temperature and combined plots reveal **seasonal patterns** and fluctuations in climate variables.  
- Wind speed and mean pressure show minor variations without strong seasonal trends.

All cleaned data is saved as `Cleaned_DailyDelhiClimate.csv`, and all visualizations including line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and combined plots are saved in the `images/` folder. The analysis provides insights into Delhi's climate patterns and can support climate awareness and sustainability initiatives.
